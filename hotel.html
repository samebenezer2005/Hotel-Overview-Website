It does not handle bookings directly, but rather directs users to partner websites to complete their reservations. To pre-book a hotel using Trivago, you would first search for your desired destination and dates on their platform, then select a hotel and be redirected to a booking site to finalize the reservation and potentially make a prepayment.  </dd>
